![Welcome to my webpage](/images/welcome.png)

This is the personal academic website of Ernesto C. Cortes-Morales, currently
a postdoctoral researcher in the [Prof. Whitmer Group](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/jonathan-whitmer/)
at [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/research/).

Bio
======
From early in my career as a Physics student, I have been interested in
out-of-equilibrium phenomena in fluids. You can find further information on
my [Publications](https://ernie2k.github.io/publications/) page.

From 2013 to 2018 I was part of the novel project [LANIMFE](http://lanimfe.ifisica.uaslp.mx/),
a research network focused on Soft Matter experimental and theoretical projects led by
Prof. Magdaleno Medina-Noyola and funded by CONACyT.
 

Other interests
------
I am currently looking for collaborations, if you are interested please write to my
 [academic email](ecortesm@nd.edu).

 In my free time I enjoy playing bass, listening to jazz and playing ball with my daughter.
