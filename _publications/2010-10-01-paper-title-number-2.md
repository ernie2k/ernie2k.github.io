permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'We report the combined results of molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical calculations concerning various dynamical arrest transitions in a model system representing a dipolar fluid, namely, N (soft core) rigid spheres interacting through a truncated dipole–dipole potential. By exploring different regimes of concentration and temperature, we find three distinct scenarios for the slowing down of the dynamics of the translational and orientational degrees of freedom: at low (η = 0.2) and intermediate (η = 0.4) volume fractions, both dynamics are strongly coupled and become simultaneously arrested upon cooling.
