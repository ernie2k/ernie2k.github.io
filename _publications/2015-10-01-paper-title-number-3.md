permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'We investigate the static correlations of a dipolar fluid in terms of the irreducible coefficients of the spherical harmonic expansion of the static structure factor. To this end, we develop a theoretical framework based on a soft-core version of Wertheim’s solution of the mean spherical approximation (MSA), which renders the analytical determination of such coefficients possible. The accuracy of this approximation is tested by a comparison against the results obtained with the assistance of extensive molecular dynamics simulations at different regimes of concentration and temperature.'
